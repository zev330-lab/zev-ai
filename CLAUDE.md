# zev.ai — AI Consulting Website + TOLA v3.0 Agent Framework

## Overview
Flagship website for Zev Steinmetz's AI consulting practice + personal operating system. Inclusive, honest public site — welcoming to businesses, freelancers, families, individuals. TOLA framework powers the backend — 11 specialized agents, 9 coordination patterns, 22 structured communication paths. Architecture is discoverable via /approach but not the headline.

**Layout architecture:** Root layout uses `LayoutWrapper` client component that conditionally renders public Navbar/Footer only for non-admin routes. Admin routes get only AdminShell sidebar — no public nav/footer overlap.

## Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (inline @theme)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (useScroll, useTransform, useInView, stagger reveals)
- **Fonts:** Sora (sans, body) + Source Serif 4 (serif, headings/editorial)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS + Realtime + Edge Functions)
- **AI:** Claude API (Sonnet) with web_search tool
- **Email:** Resend (form notifications)
- **Deployment:** Vercel + Supabase Edge Functions
- **Domain:** askzev.ai (production)

## TOLA v3.0 Agent Architecture

### 11 Agents (Tree of Life nodes)
Crown (human authority), Visionary (research), Architect (planning), Oracle (synthesis, phantom),
Guardian (validation), Nexus (routing, center), Catalyst (engagement), Sentinel (monitoring),
Prism (testing), Foundation (infrastructure), Gateway (application)

### Runtime — ALL 11 AGENTS ACTIVE
- **Pipeline functions:** pipeline-guardian (validation + quality gate), pipeline-visionary, pipeline-architect, pipeline-oracle (report gen + revision), pipeline-proposal, pipeline-gateway-delivery, pipeline-content-engine, pipeline-social-agent
- **Background agent functions (all with pg_cron):**
  - `agent-nexus` (every 5 min) — health-check all agents, health scoring, path activity aggregation
  - `agent-guardian-bg` (every 5 min) — anomaly detection, circuit breaker (10 errors → kill switch), writes health alerts to shared_context (Path 15)
  - `agent-crown` (every 15 min) — token spend tracking, Tier 3 queue scan, daily governance digest
  - `agent-prism` (every 30 min) — synthetic site health checks, agent output audit, daily quality report
  - `agent-catalyst-bg` (hourly) — pipeline velocity analysis, bottleneck detection, follow-up reminders via shared_context (Path 19)
  - `agent-gateway` (hourly) — sitemap/robots/RSS validation, SEO audit, engagement signal tracking via shared_context (Path 21)
  - `agent-foundation-bg` (every 2h) — database maintenance, row counts, archival (30-day retention + shared_context cleanup), infra health to shared_context (Path 22)
- **Nexus routing:** `nexus_route()` SQL function called by `advance_pipeline()` every minute, processes `tola_shared_context` entries addressed to Nexus
- **Legacy:** `tola-agent` single fat function (superseded by dedicated functions)
- **Supabase project:** ctrzkvdqkcqgejaedkbr

### Assessment Pipeline (22-Path Agent Collaboration)
Discovery form (or Stripe $499 webhook) → Crown writes to shared_context → Nexus routes → Guardian validates → Visionary researches (Claude + web_search, real searches) → Architect scopes (9 constraints, structured JSON contracts) → Oracle generates meeting prep + client insight report → Guardian quality gates (Claude evaluates against 6 criteria, 0.80 threshold) → Gateway auto-delivers (paid_499 track) or Crown reviews (zevgt3/free track).

**Pipeline Tracks:**
- `paid_499` — Stripe $499 payment triggers auto-delivery after quality gate passes (Tier 1)
- `friends_family_zevgt3` — Full pipeline but waits for Crown review before delivery (Tier 3)
- `free` — Full pipeline, Crown review required (Tier 3)

**Shared State (`tola_shared_context` table):** Inter-agent communication backbone. Every agent reads/writes here. Nexus routing function processes entries where `to_agent='nexus'` and routes to next agent based on path_name and payload.

**Quality Gate (Path 6):** Guardian evaluates Oracle's report against 6 criteria (specificity, honest assessment, decision forks, actionability, value, accuracy) each weighted 0.15-0.20. Pass threshold: 0.80. If `needs_revision` → Oracle revises (max 2 iterations). If still fails → Tier 3 Crown escalation.

**Delivery (Path 7):** `pipeline-gateway-delivery` sends branded email via Resend with report link. Report page at `/discovery/[id]` shows executive summary, findings, opportunities, decision forks, next steps. Tracks views for engagement signals.

**Revenue Pipeline:** $499 Insight Reports auto-deliver without human intervention: Stripe webhook → crown_to_nexus → Guardian → Visionary (real web search) → Architect → Oracle (report_data) → Guardian quality gate → Gateway auto-delivers via email → Crown notified.

**22 Paths:**
Paths 1-8: Discovery pipeline (Crown→Nexus→Guardian→Visionary→Architect→Oracle→Guardian QG→Gateway→Crown notification)
Paths 9-14: Content pipeline (Nexus→Visionary→Architect→Oracle→Guardian→Catalyst→Crown approval)
Paths 15-18: Monitoring (Sentinel/Guardian-bg→Nexus health alerts, Prism→Oracle quality metrics, Oracle daily lessons)
Paths 19-22: Nurture (Catalyst follow-up reminders, Crown→Catalyst approved follow-up, Gateway engagement signals, Foundation→Sentinel infra health)

**Proposal Generation:** After pipeline completes, "Generate Proposal" button triggers `pipeline-proposal` Edge Function. Calls Claude to generate a professional SOW with executive summary, discovery findings, phased implementation plan, deliverables, and pricing tiers. Stored in `proposal_data` JSONB column. Supports `include_pricing` toggle, PDF download via browser print, and Edit & Regenerate with custom prompt context.

**Chaining:** pg_cron polls every 60s (`advance_pipeline()`), calls `nexus_route()` first to process shared_context, then dispatches next step via pg_net with 300s timeout.
**Rate limiting:** 60-second global cooldown between Claude API calls (tracked via `pipeline_step_completed_at`).
**Retry:** Auto-retries on 429/529/timeout errors up to 5 times. Stuck in-flight steps recovered after 5 min.
**Config:** `_pipeline_config` table stores `supabase_url` and `service_role_key` for pg_net dispatch.

### Pipeline Statuses
pending → researching → scoping → synthesizing → reporting → delivering → complete | failed
Also: `revising` (Oracle revises report after Guardian quality gate feedback, max 2 loops)

### Pipeline Columns (discoveries table)
`pipeline_status`, `pipeline_error`, `pipeline_completed_at`, `pipeline_step_completed_at` (cooldown tracking), `pipeline_started_at` (in-flight guard), `pipeline_retry_count`, `progress_pct` (0-100 integer), `proposal_data` (JSONB), `include_pricing` (boolean, default true), `pipeline_track` (free|paid_499|friends_family_zevgt3), `report_data` (JSONB: report object with exec summary, findings, opportunities, decision forks, next steps, fit assessment), `quality_gate_score` (float 0-1), `revision_count` (int, max 2), `delivered_at` (timestamptz), `report_url` (text), `stripe_payment_id` (text)

### Data Contracts (spec-defined JSON payloads)
- **Visionary output:** `company_profile`, `contact_profile`, `competitive_landscape`, `industry_trends`, `existing_tech_stack`, `ai_opportunity_signals`, `research_confidence`, `sources_consulted`, `raw_sources`
- **Architect output:** `opportunities[]` (name, pain_point_addressed, proposed_solution, feasibility, estimated_effort, expected_impact, honest_caveat), `recommended_tier`, `recommended_scope`, `constraints_identified`, `fit_assessment`, `fit_reasoning`, `decision_forks[]`
- **Oracle output:** `report.executive_summary`, `report.key_findings[]`, `report.opportunities[]` (title, description, expected_impact, honest_assessment, what_i_would_do), `report.decision_forks[]` (question, options, my_recommendation, why), `report.next_steps`, `report.fit_for_zev_ai`, `delivery_ready`, `synthesis_confidence`
- **Guardian quality gate:** `scores` (specificity, honest_assessment, decision_forks, actionability, value, accuracy), `quality_score`, `verdict` (pass|fail|needs_revision), `issues[]`, `revision_instructions`

### Pipeline Progress Tracking
Each stage updates `progress_pct` as it works:
- Guardian: 0% start → 10% validated
- Visionary: 15% start → 20% Claude API call → 35% research complete
- Architect: 40% start → 45% Claude API call → 65% assessment complete
- Oracle: 70% start → 75% meeting prep → 82% → 85% report generation → 88% report complete
- Guardian QG: 88% → quality evaluation → 92% if passing
- Gateway: 92% → delivery → 100% complete

### Tier Enforcement
- **Report delivery:** paid_499 = Tier 1 auto-deliver | zevgt3/free = Tier 3 wait for Crown
- **Email sending:** system notification = Tier 1 | client-facing = Tier 3 wait
- **Social publishing:** approved template = Tier 2 post+notify | custom = Tier 3 wait
- **Quality threshold:** score < 0.80 = Tier 3 escalation after max revisions

### 3-Tier Decision Model
- **Tier 1 (80%):** Autonomous — UX, technical, operational, paid_499 auto-delivery
- **Tier 2 (15%):** Notify & proceed — dependencies, infrastructure, trade-offs, follow-up reminders
- **Tier 3 (5%):** Full stop — brand, creative, security, scope, quality gate failures

## Authentication & Security
- **Auth module:** `src/lib/auth.ts` — shared session token generation using Web Crypto API (SHA-256)
- **Session tokens:** Admin password is never stored in cookies. Login route hashes password → stores hex digest in `admin_auth` cookie (httpOnly, secure, sameSite: lax, 7-day expiry)
- **Middleware:** `src/middleware.ts` — protects `/admin/*` routes (except `/admin/login`) by validating hashed session token
- **API auth:** All admin API routes import `isValidSession` from `@/lib/auth` and verify the cookie hash matches
- **Agent trigger validation:** `POST /api/admin/agents/trigger` validates agent name against whitelist of 15 known Edge Functions
- **Input validation:** `_type` params validated in projects/finance/family routes; bulk operations capped at 100 items

Full Standard Operating Procedures document at `src/docs/OPERATIONS-SOP.md` covering: daily ops checklist, content workflow, social media, discovery pipeline, proposal workflow, family hub, knowledge base, project management, invoicing, troubleshooting, and monthly review.

### Content Generation Pipeline
Edge Function `pipeline-content-engine` — 5-step content generation with pg_cron advancement:
1. **topic_research** (Visionary) — web_search for trending AI topics, cross-ref existing posts, select topic from 6 pillars
2. **outlining** (Architect) — AEO-optimized outline with question-format headers, FAQ section, target keywords
3. **drafting** (Oracle) — Full 1,500-2,500 word blog post in Zev's voice
4. **reviewing** (Guardian) — Quality score, SEO score, brand consistency check, issue flagging
5. **social_gen** (Catalyst) — 3-5 platform-specific social variants (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Threads)

Status flow: topic_research → outlining → drafting → reviewing → social_gen → review (human approval) → published
Each step respects 60s Claude API cooldown. pg_cron polls every 60s via `advance_content_pipeline()`.
Weekly auto-generation: pg_cron creates new post every Sunday 8am EST.

## Social Distribution System

### Architecture
Content Pipeline → Social Agent → Social Queue → [Admin Approve] → Distribution Engine → Platform APIs
All custom-built — no paid third-party posting tools.

### Platform Posting (`src/lib/social-platforms.ts`)
Direct API integration for 5 platforms:
- **Twitter/X:** v2 API — text posts + media upload via v1.1 endpoint
- **LinkedIn:** REST API v2 — text + image posts with image upload flow (initializeUpload → PUT binary → create post with image URN)
- **Instagram:** Graph API v21.0 — container creation → media_publish (requires image)
- **Threads:** Threads API v1.0 — container → publish (text or image)
- **TikTok:** Content Posting API v2 — photo mode posting (video via HeyGen stub)

### Branded Image Generation (`/api/og/social`)
Server-side image generation using Next.js `ImageResponse` (Satori):

### Cost Optimization (tola_config)
Admin toggle: $ (low) / $$ (medium) / $$$ (high)
- **Low:** Haiku model, text-only posts, MWF cadence, max 3 posts/batch

- **High:** Sonnet for all, full image generation, daily cadence (including weekends), max 10 posts/batch
Config stored in `tola_config` table, managed via `/api/admin/settings`.

### Admin Content Page Enhancements

## LLM Chat Interfaces

### Public Chat Widget (`src/components/chat-widget.tsx`)
- Floating button on all public pages (bottom-right, periwinkle with green pulse dot)
- Opens dark-themed chat panel matching site design
- Claude Haiku model (fast, cost-effective for visitor queries)
- System prompt with full service/pricing/case study knowledge + natural lead qualification
- Suggested starter questions for empty state
- Rate limited: 10 messages/minute per IP, context trimmed to last 10 messages, max 512 tokens
- Graceful fallback if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set
- **Chat-to-Pipeline Integration:** After 3+ user messages, a second Haiku call extracts contact info (name, email, company, role, pain points, interest level). If email found → auto-creates contact in CRM. If high interest + business context → auto-creates discovery with `pipeline_status: pending`, triggering the full Guardian → Visionary → Architect → Oracle assessment pipeline. All activity logged to `tola_agent_log` under Catalyst agent. Duplicate-safe via email matching.
- API route: `POST /api/chat`

### Admin Chat (`src/components/admin/admin-chat.tsx`)
- Sparkle icon button in admin dashboard (bottom-right)
- Claude Sonnet model (full capability for architecture/content questions)
- **Data-connected:** Queries live data from ALL admin modules before each response (discoveries, contacts, invoices, agents, family tasks, content queue, agent costs). "What should I prioritize?" returns specific names, numbers, and actionable recommendations.
- Up to 20 messages context, 2048 max tokens
- Auth-protected via session cookie
- API route: `POST /api/admin/chat` (requires admin auth)

### Required: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in Vercel env vars
Chat routes call Claude API directly. Set via `vercel env add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

## Email Configuration
- **Public-facing email:** hello@askzev.ai (all site references updated)
- **Notification delivery:** Configurable via `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` env var (defaults to zev330@gmail.com)

## Required Secrets

### Vercel env vars
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (optional — for $499 Insight Report payment verification)

### Supabase Edge Function secrets
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — **REQUIRED for assessment pipeline.** Set via: Supabase Dashboard > Project Settings > Edge Functions > Secrets, or `supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`

## Design System
- **Background:** dark navy (#0a0e1a)
- **Foreground:** off-white (#d0d0da), strong (#f0f0f5)
- **Accent:** periwinkle (#7c9bf5), hover (#96aff8)
- **Muted light:** #c4b5e0
- **Sections:** Alternating dark/light via `.section-light`
- **Admin:** Dark theme using --color-admin-* CSS variables
- **Easing:** [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1] throughout
- **CRITICAL:** No Kabbalah/Hebrew references in public-facing code. Agents use secular names (Crown, Visionary, etc.)
- **CRITICAL:** Public pages are outcome-forward. No agent names, geometry engine names, or technical architecture on homepage or services. Architecture details live on /approach only.
- **CRITICAL:** No fake client names anywhere public-facing. Only reference real projects (Steinmetz RE, KabbalahQ.ai, askzev.ai itself).
- **CRITICAL:** Use "your situation" not "your business" in public copy. Site is inclusive — individuals, families, freelancers welcome, not just businesses.
- **CRITICAL:** Use "I" not "we" in public copy. This is one person's practice, not a firm.
- **Copy tone:** Confident but understated. No puffery, no inflated stats, no claims that can't be backed up. Let the work speak.
